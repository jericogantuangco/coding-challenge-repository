# Problem Set 2: Valid Parentheses

## Problem Description
Given a string containing just the characters `'(',')','{','}','[',']'`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

## Solution Overview
Created a database that stored the characters with its valid enclosing character and made use of a stack data structure to make sure that the parentheses are valid.

## Instructions to run the code
```
$ python valid_parentheses.py
```
